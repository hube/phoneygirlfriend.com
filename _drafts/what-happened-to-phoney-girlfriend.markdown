title: "What Happened to Phoney Girlfriend?"
---

On February 20, Google took down the Phoney Girlfriend app with the following notice:

> **REASON FOR SUSPENSION**: Violation of the [sexually explicit material](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html#sexual-content) provision of the Content Policy.
>
> After a regular review, we have determined that your app contains images with nudity. This violates the Content Policy. Please refer to the [Sex and Nudity policy help article](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/4450958) for more information.


> Our app was erroneously suspended from the app store for
> sexually explicit material. Phoney Girlfriend neither contains nor promotes
> pornography. None of the images included or downloadable through the app
> are pornographic or depict nudity, and there is no sexually explicit or
> erotic content. While there are some suggestive images, these reveal no
> more than would commonly found swimwear.
>
> Our app is a relationship-themed text-based adventure game. We include
> content (text/voice/picture messages) typical of a relationship, from
> day-to-day interactions to more intimate situations. Much is left to the
> imagination and the content could at best be considered suggestive. Our
> intent is to provide an app that is emotionally fulfilling, not sexually
> gratifying. Therefore, though we may include images and descriptions that
> are suggestive, we would never include content that contains pornography,
> nudity, is sexually explicit, or erotic.
