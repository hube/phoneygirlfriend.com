Phoney Girlfriend has been out for less than a month, but from our Google Play and Amazon sales data, we know that it can be a huge hit. Soon after launch, we typically only get around twenty downloads a day. While we see some growth, we're really impatient and want to push it to grow quicker.

It's possible to pay for downloads and there are two ways of doing this:

**1. Incentivized Traffic**

Users are given an incentive for installing your app. For example, you're playing HayDay, and there's an offer that says "Install Phoney Girlfriend and receive 100 Hay Day Gold.". You can get a really low CPI (Cost Per Install) from incentivized traffic platforms, but the quality of installs isn't that great. Users typicall install your app and then go back to playing game they were diverted from.

I've heard a lot of people user incentivized traffic to boost their apps rankings on the App Store.

**2. Non-Incentivized Traffic**

You display an ad, and people click on it if they think it's compelling/interesting. This is the more traditional way of marketing stuff. The CPI should be higher, but the quality of your users should be a lot better as well.

**Last Week's Admob Campaign**

Last week we ran two campaigns on Ad Mob for 7 days at $20 USD a day. The results are pretty significant, clicks were about the same for both apps, but Phoney Girlfriend had a much higher install rate. We spent $140 on both campaigns so we get these results:

PG CPI = $140 / 215 = $0.65 
PB CPI = $140 / 71 = $1.97

**What makes a quality user?**

We need a defintion for a quality user. One idea might be someone who spends money in the app. That's obviously something we want, but the problem is 95% of people will never spend money on an IAP. This means our sample size will be small. Perhaps a better metric will be people play the app a day later.

**What's next?**

We're running a Facebok Ad Campaign this week, this time only for Phoney Girlfriend and we'll be running it at $40 USD a day. I'll share the results of the campaign next week.
