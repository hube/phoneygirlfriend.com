We've been working hard on the next version of Phoney Girlfriend and Phoney
Boyfriend. Here's a small preview of what's coming in the next update.

## New Characters
We're introducing two new girlfriends and one new boyfriend in the next update.

## New Features

### Android Download Manager

<table style="table-layout: fixed; width: 100%; border-spacing: 1em;">
<tr>
<td markdown="1" style="width:70%">
We're now taking advantage of Android's built-in
[DownloadManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html)
to download character content packs. This means that we can more reliably
download content and we can perform downloads in the background, so you can
start your chat immediately!

The old download system we were using was based on Android's
[AsyncTask](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html),
which, though well-suited for background jobs, raised exceptions when the
hosting activity was paused (e.g. the user backed out of the Activity or another
app came to the foreground).

*Goodbye download progress dialog!*

## Living in a Material World
Last June at [Google I/O](https://www.google.com/events/io), Google announced
its newest UI paradigm,
[Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html),
which launched with the latest Android 5.0 devices in November. Material Design
has now arrived for Phoney Girlfriend and Phoney Boyfriend! We've refreshed many
UI elements to stay up-to-date with this new design.

<table style="table-layout: fixed; width: 100%; border-spacing: 1em;">
<tr>
<td markdown="1" style="width:50%">
![New dialogs](/assets/2015-04-10-new-hotness/material-dialogs.png "New dialogs")

*Material style dialogs*
</td>
<td markdown="1" style="width:50%">
![New App Bar](/assets/2015-04-10-new-hotness/material-app-bar.png "App Bar")
