Phoney Girlfriend and Boyfriend have been on the Amazon App Store since December 2014. We've had pretty good sales and downloads there, but we've noticed a strange thing about the downlaods on Amazon. Every now and then they will drop down to about one third of where they normally are, and stay there for a few days to a few weeks, then rise back up to where they were before. We're calling it the Amazon Bucket.

**Common Features**

1. Often happens at the start of a new month
2. Lasts for about two weeks.
3. Usually about one third the downloads of before.

**Why does this happen?**

No idea really. If you've noticed this on your Amazon App, let me know @BallerIndustry on twitter.
