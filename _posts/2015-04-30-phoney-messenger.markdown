I came up with the idea for Phoney Girlfriend during the later stages of working on <a href="http://ballerindustries.com/tokyo-hosto/">Tokyo Hosto</a>. The idea was to take the core game play out of Tokyo Hosto, and merge it with a chat application. Phoney Girlfriend proved to be <a href="http://ballerindustries.com/2014/06/phoney-girlfriend-is-profitable/">really popular</a> pretty soon after launching.

**Problem 1 - I want to work on more games like Tokyo Hosto**

I miss working full fledged games with lots of graphics, animation and audio. The best part of game development is watching people playing your games and enjoying them.

At the 6:25 mark in the KSI video above, one of the presenter's makes a drum snare noise in response to a really bad pun the game makes. The thing is, I also added in a drum snare to highlight the lameness of the joke. It's a really funny moment, as the guy makes a drum snare sound exactly when the game does it.

**Problem 2 - It's difficult to make a hit game**

The problem is it takes a really long time and a lot of money to put those games together. That's okay if you're game makes a lot of money, but it really sucks if the game tanks. It's hard to know what games will be a huge hit, no one really knows. I've made seven games, and I intended all of them to be hits but only two of them were.

**Problem 3 - Phoney Girlfriend isn't for everyone**

Phoney Girlfriend is a pretty fun game, but it isn't exactly main stream. Sometimes I show Phoney Girlfriend to people and pretend it isn't my app, a lot of the time people dismiss it as boring and don't get it at all. Some people really like it though.

**Solving those three problems**

We are working on a new engine that allows for something we are calling **situation** scripts where you play as a fictional character, and talk to other fictional characters. Right now in Phoney Girlfriend, the girlfriend is a fictional character, and you are someone without too much of a personality. So for example, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/161SMIPTk0GePdBdA7lHpDLrXz5-oDq8K9eV8LsYwFQI/edit?usp=sharing">I am working on a script</a> where you play as Kim Jong Un, and you have to keep a hold of power during a tense political period.

You’ll receive messages from your advisers, army generals, Ambassador Rodman and Barack Obama. The game play will be the same, you make a decision out of three choices. Make the wrong decision and something terrible happens.

These situation scripts should be appealing to a wider set of people, which solves problem #3. The next part is genius. We create a bunch of different scripts, describing lots of different situations. Whichever script is the most successful, we will turn into a full fledged game. Solving problem #2 and problem #1. QED!

With that kind of logic how can we fail? Don't worry we'll figure out a way to.
