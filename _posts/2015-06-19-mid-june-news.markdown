**Google EYE Round Two**

[We've made it into round two of the Google EYE program](http://entrepreneurship.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/eyeprogram/osr150617). 
35 out of 78 teams made it to round two. That means we're in the top 45%. 
On July 11th Hubert and I will need to give a fifteen minute presentation to a 
set of judges. Ten teams are selected for the third and final stage. At that 
point we'll be given a mentor, who is going to guide us towards extreme 
entrepreunerial glory.

**Live Streaming**

Lately I've been live streaming myself as a refactor my first game
Get Rich or Die Gaming. I'm considering live streaming myself as I work
on Phoney Messenger. I probably wont live stream the entire development,
because explaining everything as I go really slows me down quite a bit.
