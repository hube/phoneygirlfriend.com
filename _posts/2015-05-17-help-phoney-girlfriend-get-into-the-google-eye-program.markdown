  Angus and I are applying for the
  [Google EYE program](http://entrepreneurship.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/eyeprogram) in
  Hong Kong. This program will help provide us with the mentorship and support we
  need to bring you the next great version of Phoney Girlfriend. The program is
  designed to help young entrepreneurs like yours truly to build their business
  and take it to the next level.

Angus and I have been working on Phoney Girlfriend for the past year and a half
or so, with each release bringing new features, new characters, and bugfixes.
We're both extremely grateful for your support and feedback. Phoney Girlfriend
wouldn't be the same without you! We'd like to invite you to join us on our
next phase of development with Google EYE.

As part of the Google EYE application, we need to post a
[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CvYu94bKlmA) and get **200 likes by June 1**.
If you can help us reach 200 likes by the deadline, as a token of our thanks,
we'll offer the next girlfriend and boyfriend we release for **free**! Please
tell your friends to **like** and **share** our video!
