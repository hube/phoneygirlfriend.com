A couple weeks ago, we
[announced](/2015/05/17/help-phoney-girlfriend-get-into-the-google-eye-program.html)
that the next girlfriend and boyfriend that we release would be free if our
[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CvYu94bKlmA) hit 200 thumbs up by June 1. Today
we're happy to announce that **we hit that goal**!

Just last week we released a new version of Phoney Boyfriend with our latest
boyfriend Andy unlocked.

> Andy is a heartthrob of a fitness model with a little bit of a bad boy side.
> He launched his modeling campaign at nineteen and is now pretty famous at the
> age of 24. However, working out isn't all that Andy is known forâ€”he also used
> to play guitar for a punk band called The Mohawk Weasels. The bad boy image
> isn't all that Andy has going for him, though. He is actually really sensitive
> and caring underneath his tough exterior. He wants someone worth showing his
> good side. Do you think you could be it?
