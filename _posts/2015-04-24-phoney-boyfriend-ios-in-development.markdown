I'm happy to announce today that we are working on a version of Phoney Boyfriend
for iOS! We are currently in a very early stage of development, but as you can
see, some core features and basic UI elements are already present.

There are still a whole lot of features missing that we are working to
implement. The UI is functional, but needs a whole lot of polish. Angus and I
both are new to iOS development, so progress will be slow while we figure
everything out.

We don't have a specific timeframe for the release of the iOS version of Phoney
Boyfriend. You can be sure we'll announce it here on our website when it's done!

Before I go, I'll leave you with a couple other screenshots from our prototype.
